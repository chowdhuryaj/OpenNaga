## Ways to contribute

### Report bugs or request features
Open an [issue](https://github.com/Zer0codestuff/OpenNaga/issues/new) with details about what you've experienced or what you'd like to see.

### Add support for your Razer mouse
If you have a different Razer mouse model (Naga Trinity, Naga Pro, etc.) and want to help add support:

1. Run the app from Terminal:
   ```bash
   /Applications/OpenNaga.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenNaga
   ```

2. Press your side buttons and copy the `[HID]` log output

3. Open an issue with:
   - Your mouse model
   - Connection type (USB/Bluetooth/Dongle)
   - The console logs

I'll use this info to add support for your device!
